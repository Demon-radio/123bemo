Intro & installation

This quickstart shows how to set up the Flags SDK and @flags-sdk/statsig adapter, which are designed for server or middleware environments.

Also refer to the Statsig adapter documentation for a detailed walkthrough.

Install with npm install flags @flags-sdk/statsig

2

Connect a project

Start by connecting to your existing project and then run vercel link in the CLI to link to the project locally.

3

Pull your latest environment variables

Run vercel env pull to make the latest environment variables available to your project locally.

Setup flags.ts

The flags SDK uses an identify function, which provides a user object for any request. The user attributes are used to check the flag against its rules.

Create a flags.ts file, with a simple identify function and a function to check our gate:


// flags.ts
import { statsigAdapter, type StatsigUser } from "@flags-sdk/statsig";
import { flag, dedupe } from "flags/next";
import type { Identify } from "flags";

export const identify = dedupe((async () => ({
  // implement the identify() function to add any additional user properties you'd like, see docs.statsig.com/concepts/user
  userID: "1234" //for example, set userID
})) satisfies Identify<StatsigUser>);

export const createFeatureGate = (key: string) => flag<boolean, StatsigUser>({
  key,
  adapter: statsigAdapter.featureGate((gate) => gate.value, {exposureLogging: true}),
  identify,
});

Create a feature fate in Statsig

Open Statsig by clicking on "Open in Statsig" from the Vercel dashboard and create a new Feature Gate (flag) in Statsig called my_feature_gate. This gate will be used by the flag declared in the next step.

6

Use the flag

Use the feature flag in a `page.tsx file by calling it as a function.


// app/page.tsx
import { createFeatureGate } from "../flags";

export default async function Page() {
  const enabled = await createFeatureGate("my_first_gate")(); //Disabled by default, edit in the Statsig console
  return <div>myFeatureGate is {enabled ? "on" : "off"}</div>
};
That's it! See Statsig adapter for detailed instructions and advanced patterns.
